# Generative-Ai-project
Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models designed to create new content—such as text, images, audio, code, or even 3D designs—based on patterns learned from large datasets. Unlike traditional AI systems that mainly classify or predict, generative AI produces original outputs that can closely resemble human-created work.
